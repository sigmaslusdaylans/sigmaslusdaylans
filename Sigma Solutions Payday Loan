A fast cash loan is a personal loan that is funded quickly. All the lending networks weâ€™ve reviewed above can deposit funds into a bank account within one business day.

That means if you apply on Monday, you could receive your money on Tuesday. It also means that if you apply on Friday, you may not receive your money until Monday.

A cash loan can be a short-term loan that requires repayment within days, weeks, or a few months (loan terms vary by the direct lender you work with and the state you live in). But a cash loan can also be an installment loan that is repaid over several months or years.

Short-term loan options usually charge the highest interest rates and fees and are for small loan amounts. Installment loans charge lower interest rates and are for larger loan amounts.
